Overview of the modes
=====================

Overview of the individual modes
--------------------------------

The available operating modes are assigned to the block families:

- Motors, valves and dosers
- Controllers
- Blocks without "Manual" and "Automatic" modes

You can find an overview below. Click on one of the operating modes to go directly to the relevant detailed description.

You can find a :doc:`State graph of the operating modes` at the end of this section.


Operating modes for motors, valves and dosers
---------------------------------------------

The following operating modes are available:

- :doc:`Local mode`
- :doc:`Automatic mode <Manual and automatic mode for motors, valves and dosers>`
- :doc:`Manual mode <Manual and automatic mode for motors, valves and dosers>`
- :doc:`Out of service`

The mode with the lowest number in the list above has the highest priority. "Manual" and "Automatic" modes have the same priority. General information on the individual modes is available in the following sections. The sections also include block-specific information, for example, non-standard parameter assignment. Refer to the description and function of the relevant blocks.


Operating modes for controllers
-------------------------------

The following operating modes are available:

- :doc:`Automatic mode <Manual and automatic mode for control blocks>`
- :doc:`Manual mode <Manual and automatic mode for control blocks>`
- :doc:`Program mode for controllers`
- :doc:`Out of service`

The mode with the lowest number has highest priority. "Manual" and "Automatic" modes have the same priority. General information on the individual modes is available in the following sections. The sections also include block-specific information, for example, non-standard parameter assignment. Refer to the description and function of the relevant blocks.


Operating modes for blocks without "Manual" and "Automatic" operation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following operating modes are available:

- :doc:`On`
- :doc:`Out of service`

The mode with the lowest number has highest priority. General information on the individual modes is available in the following sections. The sections also include block-specific information, for example, non-standard parameter assignment. Refer to the description and function of the relevant blocks.

.. note::
   Note that the operating modes are realized differently in the individual block families.
